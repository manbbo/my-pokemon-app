# About the project

I used MvvMI (Model View ViewModel Interface) to make this app and it uses Fragments to create the pokemons listing.

I also created a "Showcase" so you can see all 5 main pokemons, and then a list getting the rest of it.

Created an Application as well so I could better manage items such as Context and global variables.


# Development setup
