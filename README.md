# About the project

I decided to separate it into pages of 20 items, because it'd be lighter and smoother for the user to use. I also made it really simple so the user can scroll easily through them. I've put all in order (got their IDs) so you can also see their evolution and position.

In addition, when you click an Item, you're transported to the Pokémon Detailed page, where you can see their name in BOLD, its front photo, its types, and a scrollable list of attacks.

# Development setup

Else, you can just use Visual Code or any other IDE that supports Android development with Kotlin;

Go to File>Settings>Go to Pluggins and search and download Kotlin, or if your Android Studio came with it, you do not need to do anything;
